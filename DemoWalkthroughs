Demos:
Simple Volume
 - create simple volume
   - based on existing volume 
 - destroy this one

Simple PVC
 - create simple-pvc.yaml
   - based on existing volume
   - walk through selector labels
   - PVCs are namespaced!

Exclusive SC + PVC 
 - What is the use case
   - importing existing volumes
 - create pv + SC 
 - create successful combo
 - show it works 
   - same volume as previous examples
 - delete
   - show that PV is released but not available
   - have discussion about reclaim policies and how recycle can be set to something custom in the master controller
 - delete PV/recreate
 - create failure template
   - show events 
   - show this only works if all claims have a label, no label and this will grab the existing pv 
 - create successful one again.

Dynamic PVC
 - comment out the label from the Exclusive failure pod 
 - takes ~35 seconds to spin up 

StatefulSet Demo
 - walk through existing configs
   - stateful-set.yaml
   - stateful-set-ingress.yaml
 - set data on node 3 to something new
 - show data is there
 - edit replicas to 2
   kubectl edit statefulset stateful-set 
 - wait for pod to die
 - show that PVC/PV still exist
 - verify it gets s 502 back 
   - this is because the SVC has an invalid endpoint object
 - edit stateful set again, set replicas to 3
 - wait for pod to come up, grab new ip
 - edit endpoint with new ip
   kubectl edit endpoint stateful-set-three
 - check that data still present
